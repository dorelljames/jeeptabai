# JeepTaBai

JeepTaBai allows commuters ask directions to help them get from place A to B or get routes of specific jeepney # like 03B, 13C  and some other little things like fare updates, strikes and probably anything I could think of later.

## Why did you create JeepTaBai?

It started as a problem for me going around the city because I don't know which jeepney to ride if I was say at UC Banilad and I want to go Escario. And so, I would then ask my friends on what jeepney should I get, bla bla bla. You see, it's gonna take a while and probably this might be the case for someone else. With that, I think this will be pretty useful for anyone who's not familiar with places around the city or even with regular commuters who would like to explore Cebu.

## Have you heard any projects similar to this?

Yes, of course. Google maps does a pretty good job to get around places but I doubt a lot of people are using the navigation system they offer. Plus, I don't think they have already added support to jeepney commuting as of the time of this writring. I also heard about sakay.ph which is I think pretty popular in Manila. They're doing a pretty good job only that it's not yet available here in Cebu.

## What are your goals on this project?

I want this project to succeed and help a lot of people go places. And say if I could hit this nationwide, why not? I want this to be the simplest app you can ever get to provide you directions.
