# JeepTaBai

JeepTaBai allows commuters ask directions getting them from place A to B, get routes of specific jeepney and other things like fare updates, strikes and probably more.

# Why did you create JeepTaBai

It started as a problem for me to go around the city because I don't know which jeepney to ride if I was say at Talamban and I want to go Escario. In that, I think I also wanted to allow help anyone or regular commuters to easily go places by riding a jeepney because that's what's easily affordable, right? So yeah, that's why I created this.

# Have you heard about sakay.ph

Yeah. Definitely yes. They're doing something great in Manila plus they're not tied up with just jeepney and they do have like buses and other transpo related things.
